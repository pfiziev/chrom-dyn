TODO:
1. Find bins that belong to the best scoring paths and view them in the browser.
2. Incorporate previous and next bins as possible sources.


We have two problems:

1. There is noise (especially with respect to the empty state). Sometimes in a long region that consists of one state,
there are holes of empty states with posterior probabilities almost equal to the posteriors of the other state.

2. There are a lot of fluctuations in the size of the regions that can be attributed to expansions, contractions or just random noise.

TODO:
For each source look for possible target segments. For example, enhancer that transforms to empty state, etc.


June 25:

DREM for histone modifications:

1. Call enhancers: take the bin with the highest signal within an enhancer segment. Call it center of the enhancer.
2. Take 2kb window around the center.
3. Take the raw signal for all marks in the window. Normalize it by the read depth.
4. Condition on one mark. Input to DREM. Treat histone mark levels as expression levels. Look for splits.
5. Next step: model the marks in the window with a multi-variate distribution. Look for splits.
